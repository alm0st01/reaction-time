## How it Works

This game is all about how fast 
you can react to a certain animation.
In this case, it's the Formula 1 Start Lights.
To start, click the spacebar. This will start the
countdown process. To record a reaction time, when
all 5 lights go off, click the space bar as fast as
you can. If you click the spacebar too early, you
jumpstarted.

## Changelog

Version 1.0 (June 26th, 2024):
- Basic concept of reaction time is created
- Key input is synchronized with the program
- Tkinter application is created

## Bugs
- There are none so far that I have seen, but if there are any,
please write the issue in the "Issues" section on this repository.


## Future Goals
- Create a settings window
  - Create a select custom keybind option
  - Create an option to change the range of the randomly generated time between
  when all the lights are on to when they
  turn off
- Create a high score widget
  - The goal is to save this as an environmental variable

## Note

Because of latency delays from device to device, your score
may not be accurate. This factor only depends on the speed of
your device on how it receives input.


If this project does look similar, the idea of this project is from another developer (jaffathecake is his username).
However, all of the code here is entirely original and created by me.
